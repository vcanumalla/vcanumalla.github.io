## Abstract

We present sinking-point, a floating-point-like number system that tracks
precision dynamically though computations. With existing floating-point number
systems, such as the venerable IEEE 754 standard, numerical results do not
inherently contain any information about their precision or accuracy; to
determine if a result is numerically accurate, a separate analysis must be
performed. By contrast, sinking-point records the precision of each
intermediate value and result computed, so highly imprecise results can be
identified immediately. Compared to IEEE 754 floating-point, sinking-point‚Äôs
representation requires only a few additional bits of storage, and
computations require only a few additional bitwise operations. Sinking-point
is fully generalizable, and can be extended to provide dynamic error tracking
for nearly any digital number system, including posits.
