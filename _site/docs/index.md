Hi! I'm a third year undergraduate studying computer science at the University of Washington. I'm part of the PLSE research group, where I am lucky to
be advised by Gus Smith and Zachary Tatlock. My main interests lie in applying programming languages and compiler techniques to new domains. I currently work 
on the 3LA project, where our team proposes a methodology for hardware developers to better test and validate their custom hardware. I was also fortunate to be advised by Chandrakana Nandi while on internship at Certora.
