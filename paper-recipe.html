<h1>[Zachary Tatlock[] / Paper Recipe (draft)</h1>
<p>The point of writing a paper is to help others.
After reading your paper, someone should know how to do something they
couldn’t do before or have some idea for how to approach a problem.
You should know what they will or should do differently going forward.</p>
<p>A great paper has to have 4 big components:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Problem
<ul>
<li>
No one will care about anything you’ve done till they care about the problem you’re trying to solve.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Opportunity
<ul>
<li>
How good could things be if you solved this problem?
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Insight
<ul>
<li>
You must show some simple, clever insight that makes the problem “fall apart”.
</li>
<li>
The insight also has to transcend the particular problem and have clear applications outside this paper.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Claims
<ul>
<li>
You must make concrete claims about the insight, e.g., how much better it is than SOTA.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Evidence
<ul>
<li>
You must provide evidence to support the claims.
</li>
<li>
For “systems papers” this probably means tables and graphs.
</li>
<li>
For “theory papers” this probably theorems and proofs.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
