## Abstract

We present a new approach to e-matching based on relational join; in
particular, we apply recent database query execution techniques to guarantee
worst-case optimal run time. Compared to the conventional backtracking approach
that always searches the e-graph "top down", our new relational e-matching
approach can better exploit pattern structure by searching the e-graph
according to an optimized query plan. We also establish the first data
complexity result for e-matching, bounding run time as a function of the
e-graph size and output size. We prototyped and evaluated our technique in the
state-of-the-art egg e-graph framework. Compared to a conventional baseline,
relational e-matching is simpler to implement and orders of magnitude faster in
practice.
