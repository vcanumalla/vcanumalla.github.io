<h1><a href="https://ztatlock.net/">Zachary Tatlock</a> / Anxiety, Carts, Horses</h1>
<p>At some point or other,
many students thrash under anxiety.
They are miserable and cannot make good progress,
which makes them more miserable and leads to less progress.
It is a real bummer.</p>
<p>From experience, such ‚Äúanxiety traps‚Äù
generally fall into one of two categories:</p>
<p><em>Will this project ever be done? Will it even work?</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>No. At least not in the way we hope, and that is OK.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Occasionally someone will want
an upfront guarantee that
a project idea will definitely succeed.
Anyone who promises guaranteed success
is either pitching unambitious ideas
or lying.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>More often, doubt and worry cause trouble
after the initial excitement about a project
has given way to the endless challenges of
proof engineering and system building.
Solving big problems
is difficult and
can gradually exhaust our energy.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Ambitious projects just come with
tremendous uncertainty and
require a staggering amount of effort.
This means the team will continually be
working through setbacks,
grinding through engineering tasks,
and adjusting goals in ways that
make our earlier efforts ‚Äúuseless‚Äù.
Of course,
none of the early work is actually useless.
We often couldn‚Äôt have figured out the
best approach without first observing what
went wrong with the alternatives!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We mitigate risk by
following <a href="https://slyubomirsky.github.io/lex.html">Lex Lyubomiricus</a>,
<a href="build-simple-first.html">building the simplest thing first</a>,
and striving to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fail-fast">fail fast</a>.
However,
even after investing significant time and energy,
failure is always an option.
If a project does fail, we will
take some time to reflect and recharge,
remind ourselves that
mistakes are the only way we learn,
write up the lessons learned
as a technical report or blog post,
and then start on the next project
armed with valuable, hard-won experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Truth is,
we have a very low failure rate.
While every project ‚Äúfails‚Äù
in the sense that we significantly
modify the initial vision and goals,
we almost always eventually pivot into success
by persistently following the problem
and learning along the way.
So have faith and keep pushing.
We will get there!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Am I ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù?</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Yes.</strong> You are more than good enough.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Avoid the terrible trap of
comparing yourself to others.
It is always toxic and counterproductive.
You and everyone else have different
strengths and challenges.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Long-term success is built on diligence and persistence.
Once you develop a good, healthy routine,
you can be diligent and persistent by
showing up to the lab or classroom
every day and putting in good, mindful effort.
So you are good enough.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Good work often follows from <em>unconditionally assuming</em>
a confident, optimistic attitude.
This assumption may feel backward:
shouldn‚Äôt we only get to feel confident <em>after</em>
delivering successful results?
<strong>No.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>First,
you are good and should feel good, period.
Second,
confidence is more responsible for
causing success than
the other way around.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If you need help rationalizing
unconditional confidence, game it out:
even if you were not ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù (though you are!),
assuming you belong and can deliver great results
will be more fun and significantly increase
the chance of success, so go for it!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The common element to both these strategies:
<strong>assume you will succeed</strong>,
even before you do.</p>
<p>Of course, all this is easier said than done.
Paying attention to your thoughts and feelings often helps.
Notice how anxiety can become a habit.
Establish routines to pull yourself out of the vicious cycle.
For example:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Take a deep breath and begin again.
</li>
<li>
Remember, we can only do one small thing at a time.
</li>
<li>
Pick one small thing and chip away at it.
</li>
<li>
Don‚Äôt worry about anything else for now.
</li>
<li>
If worrying starts to bog you down, <span class="monospace">goto</span> 1.
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you feel real stuck,
take a break to nap, exercise, cook, etc.
Or message me to chat and grab a beverage.
Most situations will seem less dire
after stepping away for a bit.
Over time,
things get easier because you will
increasingly be able to redirect energy
away from worrying and toward what you love.</p>
<p>Some may dismiss the perspectives above,
noting the influence of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias">survivorship bias</a>,
etc.
They may even be partly correct:
the world is indeed
enormously random and
monstrously unfair.
However,
such macro observations are not very
helpful for an individual.</p>
<p>Truth is,
you can‚Äôt win if you don‚Äôt play.
Folks who discourage you from even trying
are not your friends.
You have an invitation to the big leagues,
so play your heart out.
I am rooting for you.</p>
