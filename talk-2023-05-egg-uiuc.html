<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Program optimizers, synthesizers, and verifiers use term rewriting to transform
code by repeatedly applying syntactic “find and replace” rules. Unfortunately,
determining when to run which rules can be fiendishly difficult. My group has
been developing egg, a new Equality Saturation (EqSat) toolkit to address these
challenges. EqSat is now used in production in WebAssembly compilers from
Fastly, circuit design tools at Intel, and ML kernel optimizers at Google.
EqSat attempts to apply all rewrite rules in every order; it mitigates space
explosion by repurposing the e-graph data structure for congruence reasoning
from automated theorem provers. The egg EqSat toolkit provides fast
implementations for searching e-graphs and maintaining their invariants, as
well as extensions to integrate non-syntactic, domain-specific analyses and
transformations.  This talk will survey egg’s design and recent innovations
applying techniques from relational databases to improve performance,
expressiveness, and proof generation for EqSat.</p>

<p>Zachary Tatlock is an Associate Professor in the Allen School of Computer
Science and Engineering at the University of Washington. He earned his PhD from
UC San Diego and BS degrees from Purdue. At UW, Zach tries to keep up with his
students exploring the practical limits of rewrite systems, working on
compilers and runtimes to support machine learning accelerators, automatically
addressing rounding error in numerical programs, and extending programming
languages techniques to computational fabrication.</p>
