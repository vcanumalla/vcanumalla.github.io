# [Zachary Tatlock][] / About

My [research](research.html) interests include
  compilers,
  term rewriting,
  numerics,
  formal verification, and
  computational fabrication.
Outside of the lab,
  I help organize our [running club](http://raceconditionrunning.com),
  attempt small knitting projects, and
  practice cooking vegan food.
I can juggle and solve Rubikâ€™s cubes,
  but not at the same time.
Also, my name has a
  [wicked cool anagram](anagram.html).

I spent six sunny years at
  [UC San Diego](https://cse.ucsd.edu)
  working on my PhD with
  my incredible advisor [Sorin Lerner][].
Throughout grad school,
  Sorin set a stellar example of how remarkable
  doing research can be when you put students first,
  an example I strive to emulate.
I also learned many invaluable lessons
  from the great [Ranjit Jhala][],
  especially when it comes to writing and presentation:
  less is more!

I graduated from
  [Purdue University](https://www.cs.purdue.edu)
  back in Spring 2007 with
  degrees in Computer Science and Mathematics.
As an undergraduate,
  I was fortunate to work with [Suresh Jagannathan][]
  on the SML compiler [MLton](http://mlton.org).
For our Honors Project,
  advised by [Antony Hosking][],
  my good friend [Bill Harris][] and I designed and implemented a
  domain specific language to control a giant neon sculpture over the web.
I also ran the lab component of
  Purdueâ€™s introductory Java programming course
  for three years.

## Miscellaneous Photos

We have a great running group,
  [Race Condition Running](http://raceconditionrunning.com),
  that trots all over Seattle and gets brunch each week.

I am a big fan of Baja hoodies.
Luckily the [UW PLSE][PLSE] faculty also have incredible fashion sense.

I help out with a bunch of stuff around the Allen School,
  including [TGIF](https://sites.google.com/cs.washington.edu/tgif/).
Sometimes [famous guests](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~dpw/) swing by :)

I also work with [Hank Levy][] and [Adriana Schulz][]
  to write the annual faculty skit where we
  dress up and try to take things a little less seriously.

There is always something happening in the Allen School;
it can be tricky to juggle everything going on ðŸ¤¹

Once while interning at
  [MSR India](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/),
  I got to drive an auto rickshaw.

## Collaborator Alphabet Soup: Gotta Catch 'Em All

I have been very fortunate to work on projects
  with many amazing [collaborators](collaborators.html).
If your first name starts with:

>    `F, Q, U`

or your last name starts with:

>    `I, U, V, X, Y`

let's write a paper together!


## Conspiracy Theories

Did you know [the clock on your wall is probably lying to you](sundial.html)?
If you thought daylight savings was bad,
  wait till you hear about timezones!
