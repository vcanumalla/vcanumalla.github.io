3D printers with multiple extruders (or multi-headed printers) are common in
the desktop fabrication community, but are primarily used for multi-color or
multi-material printing, using only one extruder at a time. What if these
multi-headed desktop printers could also be used for simultaneous parallel
printing? While this is a relatively unexplored direction, we argue that it
deserves further investigation: a flexible, robust, and affordable parallel
printing ecosystem could significantly reduce fabrication time for many
applications and further enhance the value of desktop rapid prototyping.

We propose a research agenda to explore the development of a parallel printing
pipeline, and summarize our observations from a preliminary investigation of
simultaneous extrusion. We hope this vision will encourage and guide future
research in developing hardware, firmware, and slicers to facilitate parallel
3D printing.
