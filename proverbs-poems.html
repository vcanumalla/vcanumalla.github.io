<p>If you want to build a ship,
don‚Äôt drum up people to
gather wood, divide the work, and give orders.
Instead, teach them to yearn for
the vast and endless sea.</p>

<p>Focus on the students.
Graduating great students means
you‚Äôll produce great research.
Focusing on the research may or may not
produce great students.</p>

<blockquote class="quote">
<p>Go placidly amid the noise and the haste,
and remember what peace there may be in silence.
As far as possible,
without surrender,
be on good terms with all persons.
Speak your truth quietly and clearly;
and listen to others,
even to the dull and the ignorant;
they too have their story.
Avoid loud and aggressive persons;
they are vexatious to the spirit.</p>
<p>If you compare yourself with others,
you may become vain or bitter,
for always there will be greater and lesser
persons than yourself.
Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans.
Keep interested in your own career, however humble;
it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time.
Exercise caution in your business affairs,
for the world is full of trickery.
But let this not blind you to what virtue there is;
many persons strive for high ideals,
and everywhere life is full of heroism.</p>
<p>Be yourself.
Especially do not feign affection.
Neither be cynical about love;
for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment,
it is as perennial as the grass.
Take kindly the counsel of the years,
gracefully surrendering the things of youth.
Nurture strength of spirit to
shield you in sudden misfortune.
But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings.</p>
<p>Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness.
Beyond a wholesome discipline,
be gentle with yourself.
You are a child of the universe
no less than the trees and the stars;
you have a right to be here.
And whether or not it is clear to you,
no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.
Therefore be at peace with God,
whatever you conceive Him to be.
And whatever your labors and aspirations,
in the noisy confusion of life,
keep peace in your soul.</p>
<p>With all its sham, drudgery, and broken dreams,
it is still a beautiful world.
Be cheerful.
Strive to be happy.</p>
<p>‚Äî Desiderata by Max Ehrmann</p>

<p>Early to bed, early to rise, work like hell and advertise.</p>
<p>‚Äî Ted Turner</p>

</p>
<blockquote class="quote">
<p>Nothing in this world can take the place of persistence.
Talent will not;
nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent.
Genius will not;
unrewarded genius is almost a proverb.
Education will not;
the world is full of educated derelicts.</p>
<p>Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent.
The slogan ‚ÄòPress On!‚Äô has solved and
always will solve the problems of the human race.</p>
<p>‚Äî Calvin Coolidge</p>

<blockquote class="quote">
<p>The difference between a type system and a program analysis is that,
when a type system complains, it is the programmer‚Äôs fault.</p>

<blockquote class="quote">
<p>There are two ways of constructing a software design:
One way is to make it so simple that
there are obviously no deficiencies.
The other way is to make it so complicated that
there are no obvious deficiencies.
The first method is far more difficult.</p>

<p>Perfection is reached,
not when there is no longer anything to add,
but when there is no longer anything to take away.</p>

<blockquote class="quote">
<p>Most people are out of touch with reality
because they confuse the world as it with the world as
they think about it and talk about it and describe it.</p>
<p>‚Äî Alan Watts</p>

<blockquote class="quote">
<p>The purpose of abstracting is not to be vague,
but to create a new semantic level in which
one can be absolutely precise.</p>
