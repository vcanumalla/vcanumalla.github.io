## About 
I'm an undergraduate at the University of Washington, where I study computer science. My research interests lie in 
**programming languages**, specifically compilers and program synthesis. At the moment, I work on building better tools for specialized hardware.

I am very lucky to be advised by Zachary Tatlock and Gus Smith here at UW.

Currently, I work on Lakeroad, a tool for FPGA synthesis, via sketch-guided synthesis. I also work on the 3LA project,
a development methodology for end-to-end testing of specialized hardware. In the past, I've worked on Glenside, a language for tensor program rewriting, and a formal specification mutation generator named Gambit.
