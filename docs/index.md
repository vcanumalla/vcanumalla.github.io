## Intro 
I'm a final year undergraduate at the University of Washington, where I study computer science. I work in the PLSE group at UW.

Next year, I'll start my PhD in Electrical Engineering at Stanford University! I'm excited to move to sunny California, but secretly I will miss the cold breeze of Seattle in the winter.

## News



Mar. 2024 -- Accepted PhD At Stanford!

Mar. 2024 -- Our workshop paper on using egraphs for EDA tasks was accepted to Latte!

Dec. 2023 -- [3LA](/pubs/2023-todaes-3la.pdf) was accepted to 
TODAES 2023!

Dec. 2023 -- [Lakeroad](/pubs/2024-asplos-lakeroad.pdf) was accepted
to ASPLOS 2024!

## Research

Generally, I'm interested in compilers and programming languages, especially with applications 
in hardware and computer architecture. Currently, I work on Lakeroad, a tool for FPGA synthesis, via sketch-guided synthesis. In the past, I've worked on the 3LA project,
a development methodology for end-to-end testing of specialized hardware. I've additionally contributed to Glenside, a language for tensor program rewriting, and a formal specification mutation generator named Gambit.

I've been very lucky to work with a great group of colleagues and mentors in industry and academia.
At UW, I'm thankful to have be been advised by [Zachary Tatlock](https://ztatlock.net) and [Gus Smith](https://justg.us)
on all the projects I've worked on.

At Certora, I was advised by [Chandrakana Nandi](https://cnandi.com), who generously took on a very inexperienced
sophomore and molded him into a (potentially) great researcher!

## About

I was born in Dallas Texas, but home to me will always be Washington. I've lived here since I was 6!

I used to want to study chemistry in high school, before settling on doing chemistry and computer science. Now I only study computer science. I wonder if it will come full circle one day...


My hobbies are mostly non-technical. I especially enjoy fantasy in any medium: games, books, movies, anything really. I also am an avid wildlife photographer. I find animals give far less criticism on their portraits than my human friends do.

I enjoy snowboarding (decent), tennis (mediocre), basketball (horrendous), and running (improving)!

I have an older brother Ani, who is a Ph.D. student at UCSD CSE. He's much smarter than me, but I keep up by learning from his example.
