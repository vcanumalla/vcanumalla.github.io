# ztatlock.net

This is the repo for
  [Zachary Tatlock's website](https://ztatlock.net)
  mostly built with
  [djot](https://djot.net/) and
  [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/).

- All pages are at the top level.
- Each `.dj` file is compiled to an `.html` page.
- `REFS` provides global reference links included for each page.
- Each page includes a common header and footer (`HEAD`, `FOOT`).
- Each page's title is taken from the first line of its source `.dj`.
- All pages use the same, very simple `style.css`.

Issues and/or PRs to fix typos or missing content are welcome!
