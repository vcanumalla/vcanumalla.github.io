[^advising-quote]: I first heard this
    [Nico Habermann](https://history.computer.org/pioneers/habermann.html)
    quote from one of his students, the great
    [David Notkin](https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/notkin),
    during my interview at UW.
To get a feel for what David was like, check out his talk
    [A Software Crisis? Please, sir, may I have some more?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye8mwGb8ExI).
