_Last updated July 2024_

  I am an incoming first year PhD student 
    in Electrical Engineering at Stanford.
  Previously, I graduated from the Allen School
    at the University of Washington (UW CSE)
    where I studied computer science.

  My research interests are in the intersection
    of programming languages and computer
    architecture. 
  I am particularly interested in using
    formal methods and compiler
    optimization techniques to improve the
    performance and efficiency of
    specialized hardware.
  Most recently I worked on using
    program synthesis in automating
    hardware compilation of FPGAs.

  At the University of Washington, I was
    very fortunate to be 
    advised by [Zachary Tatlock][] and
    [Gus Smith][]. 
  I've additionally interned in industry,
    at Certora working on mutation testing,
    and I'm currently at Adobe Research
    working on projects in the Halide
    compiler.
